why we use test cases?
when multiple dev work on same project. One can change something in code then testing helps them to ensure that new code doesn't 
break other codes OR
suppose we have 120 component and we want to add one more component to our app then testing give confidence to us the new component doesn't
break existing code.

what is test driven development?
writing test cases even before developing component.
