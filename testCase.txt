why we use test cases?
when multiple dev work on same project. One can change something in code then testing helps them to ensure that new code doesn't 
break other codes OR
suppose we have 120 component and we want to add one more component to our app then testing give confidence to us the new component doesn't
break existing code.

what is test driven development?
writing test cases even before developing component.


Type of testing
 - Manual Testing
 - Automation Testing
    - selenium Testing

 - E2E Testing - Cover whole user expreince
 - Headless browsers

 - Unit Testing - It just test small part of project
 - Integration Testing - Integration different component


 Jest :- 
    install testing library
        @testing-library/react
        jest
    configure Jest
        jest-config file npx jest --init only use one time 

    npm run test  (validate error) 
        jest-enviroment-jsdom

    create test folder __test__ (jest condier it as test files)  (dunder file)
        .test.js is industry standard

    create first test (error for import in js file)
    configre bable
     -bable-jest @bable/core @bable/present-env
      (It has two ways to configure 
        - create .json file
        - create .bablerc file
        )
    
        bable requires json (javascript object and json are different things)



test funtion expect something (expect | esecrse )
